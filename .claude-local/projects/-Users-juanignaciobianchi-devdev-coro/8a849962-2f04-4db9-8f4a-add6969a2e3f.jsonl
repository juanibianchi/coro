Description: Screen 1 (home hero) shows a dark navy background (#0b1220) with a rounded dark card containing the Coro logo near the top center, followed by a large rounded prompt card with headline 'What would you like to ask?' in light lavender, and a textarea placeholder. Below is 'Select Models' row with rounded cards (orange outlines) and the primary CTA 'Ask Multiple AIs' in a wide pill at the bottom. Screen 2 (same page scrolled) highlights the Select Models grid, response style card, and two upsell cards with Apple and key icons. Screen 3 (sidebar/history) shows a list of previous chats in tall rounded cards with an orange New Chat button at the top. Please critique the overall visual design from a professional mobile UI perspective: typography, spacing, depth, contrast, alignment, iconography, and brand personality.
